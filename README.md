Semiconductor Packaging Course Repository

A comprehensive repository for the Semiconductor Packaging course, illustrating the evolution of packaging technologies from basic concepts to advanced 3D integration. This repository combines theoretical foundations, manufacturing processes, and hands-on simulations using ANSYS Icepak and ANSYS Q3D Extractor to cover the full semiconductor packaging lifecycle from wafer to finished package.
